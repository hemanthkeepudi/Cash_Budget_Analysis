## 📊 Cash Budget Analysis of HCL Technologies

This repository contains a detailed project report titled **"Cash Budget Analysis of HCL Technologies Ltd."**, submitted as part of the academic requirements for the M.Tech Integrated program.

### 🧠 Abstract

This report presents a detailed cash budget analysis of HCL Technologies Ltd., designed to provide insights into the company's short-term liquidity management and cash flow planning. A cash budget is a vital financial tool used to monitor cash inflows and outflows over a specific period, ensuring that operations and investments are adequately funded.For a global IT services leader like HCL Tech, aligning financial resources with project-based revenue cycles and high-scale tech investments is crucial. The analysis incorporates forecasted cash receipts from core business operations and expected disbursements for salaries, infrastructure, R\&D, taxes, and capital expenses. Key metrics such as net cash flow, surplus/deficit periods, and opening/closing balances were used to evaluate financial stability.

**The data used for this analysis is collected from HCL Technologies’ official Annual Reports for FY 2022–23 and FY 2023–24.** Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess real-world disruptions like delayed payments or increased costs. Visual tools—graphs, charts, and summary tables—were employed for clarity. Overall, the cash budget provides HCL with a proactive framework for working capital management, liquidity optimization, and strategic growth.
